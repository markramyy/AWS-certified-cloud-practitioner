## Cloud Concepts (*26% of the exam*) :

### Components of a website
1. **Compute**
2. **Database**
3. **Storage**
4. **Networking**
5. **Security**

### Foundational Services 
1. Compute: Elastic Compute Cloud (**EC2**)
2. Database: Relational Database Service (**RDS**) and **DynamoDB**
3. Storage: Simple Storage Service (**S3**)
4. Networking: Virtual Private Cloud (**VPC**)
5. Security: Identity and Access Management (**IAM**)

### Benefits of the Cloud
Term | Description | Example
-- | -- | --
Elasticity | The ability to adapt to workload changes. | Amazon.com handling a huge spike in traffic on Prime Day.
Scalability | The ability to handle increased workloads by adding resources. | Scale up a database because the size has grown over time.
High availability | The ability to continue functioning even if some components fail. | When a power outage causes one data center to go down, traffic is routed to another.
Reliability | The ability to function consistently and correctly when expected. | 99.99% uptime for EC2 instances during a given month.
Agility | The ability to rapidly develop, test, and launch applications to deliver business value. | Launch a new business application in days rather than months.
Global reach | The ability to get closer to your customers through a global infrastructure. | 25 Availability Zones around the world.
Pay-as-go pricing | Only pay for what you use, and only when you need it. | An EC2 instance only used for 2 hours; only pay for 2 hours.
Economies of scale | Because of their size, AWS can purchase things more cheaply than an individual organization can. | Amazon purchases servers at a fraction of the cost that you could, and pass the savings on to you.

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Ways to Reduce Costs in AWS
- **TCO**: The sum of the up-front cost (capital expense or CapEx) and the cost to operate (operating expense or OpEx).
- With AWS, you can get rid of the capital expenses, but you still need to pay for operating expenses, though less than building your own data center.
- Ways to reduce costs in AWS:
  - Right-sized infrastructure
  - Automation
  - Compliance scope
  - Managed services

### AWS Well-Architected Framework
The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS. You should get familiar with the pillars, as they could be mentioned in the exam.

Name | Description
--- | ---
Operational Excellence | The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and continuously improve supporting process and procedures to deliver business value.
Security | The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture.
Reliability | The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS.
Performance Efficiency | The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to
