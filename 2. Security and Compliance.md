1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** : AWS will manage the bottom 4 layers and you are responsible on anything on top of that.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** : AWS will manage a few more things including the Runtime, Middleware and Operating System and you manage the applications and data.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** : AWS is responsible for everything, you just need to use the software.

### What is Identity and Access Management (IAM) ?
Service that used o securly control access to your AWS resources. It controls **Authentication** (*Who*) and **Authorization** (*What they can do*).

### You should Know go to Lab6 in introduction 101 labs which is the introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

### 1. Users

Root User | IAM User
--- | ---
One per account | Multiple per account
Unrestricted access | Users can be deleted or disabled
Difficult to restrict or revoke access | Easy to restrict access

#### A root user can perform the following tasks:

	- Close an AWS Account
	- Change an AWS support plan
	- Change AWS Account settings

*Note: For best practices always work in your IAM account not the root account, Set up IAM users with the least number of permissions needed.*

### 2. User Groups
Is a group of users that share the same roles and policies.

### 3. Role 

	- Similar to a user (an identity with permissions).
	- Does not have credentials (passwords or keys).
	- Assumable, temporarily, by anyone who needs it.

*Whatever hat you put on or whatever hat you put on as long as you are wearing this hat you can do the specific tasks with the role.*

### 4. Policies (Who can do what to which resources and when)
*Ex: Allow IAM to rotate their own credentials programmatically and in the console, Allow user to start and stop EC2 instances, etc...*

**Policy Example**
```json
{
	"Version" : "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow", 
			"Action": [
				"ec2: StartInstances",
				"ec2: StopInstances"
			],
			"Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
			"Condition": {
				"StringEquals": {
					"aws:ResourceTag/Owner": "${aws:username}" 
				}
			}
		},
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
			"Resources": "*"
		}
	]
}
