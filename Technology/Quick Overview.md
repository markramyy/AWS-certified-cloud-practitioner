#### 2. Software Developer Kit (SDK)

- Which is how you are able to write code against AWS.

- There are different Flavors in **SDK** inclucing **python**, **php**, **java**, **JavaScript**, **go**, **node** and **ruby**.

- If you are a developer,you do have plenty of options for working programmatic with AWS.

#### 3. Command Line Interface (CLI)

- It let you use the same that you can do in the browser but from the **command line** instead.
- There are some additional things that you can do in **CLI** that you can't do in the browser.
- It's kinda of personal preference of which one you use and some people find this is faster specially if you have repetitive or a bulk commands that you need to run.

#### 4. AWS CloudShell

- Relatively new edition to the tool set.
- Same as **CLI** but run in the browser and it doesn't require the same initial configuration and credentials to the **CLI** requires to run.
